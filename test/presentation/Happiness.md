# Pursing Happiness

**The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.**

---

# Pursing Happiness

**According to the research, what predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness. It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life.**

# What is the difference between being happy and having meaning in life?

**Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment. Meaning, though, is deeper.**

**The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you.**

# How can we each live more meaningfully?

**Four pillars of a meaning ful life: belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling.**

---

# Belonging

**True belonging springs from love.**
**When you lead with love, you create a bond that lifts each of you up. For many people, belonging is the moset essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends.**

---

# Purpose

**Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.**
**The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.**

---

# Transcendence

**Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected to a higher reality.**

---

# Transcendence

**One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute. But after wards they felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone.**

---

# Storytelling

**The story you tell yourself about yourself.**

**We're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them. Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts.**

---

# Redemptive story

**The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a "redemptive story," where the bad is redeemed by the good. People leading meaningful lives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love.**

---

# Meaning

**The studies show that people who have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live logner.**

---

**Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to.**
